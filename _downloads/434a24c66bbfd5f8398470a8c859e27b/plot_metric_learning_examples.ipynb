Especially in higher\ndimensions when Euclidean distances are a poor way to measure distance, this\nbecomes very useful.\n\nBasically, we learn this distance:\n$D(x, x') = \\sqrt{(x-x')^\\top M(x-x')}$. And we learn the parameters\n$M$ of this distance to satisfy certain constraints on the distance\nbetween points, for example requiring that points of the same class are\nclose together and points of different class are far away.\n\nFor more information, check the `intro_metric_learning` section\nfrom the documentation.

        "Metric Learning from Weaker Supervision\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nTo learn the metric, so far we have always given the labels of the\ndata to supervise the algorithms. However, in many applications,\nit is easier to obtain information about whether two samples are\nsimilar or dissimilar. For instance, when annotating a dataset of face\nimages, it is easier for an annotator to tell if two faces belong to the same\nperson or not, rather than finding the ID of the face among a huge database\nof every person's faces.\nNote that for some problems (e.g., in information\nretrieval where the goal is to rank documents by similarity to a query\ndocument), there is no notion of individual label but one can gather\ninformation on which pairs of points are similar or dissimilar.\nFortunately, one of the strength of metric learning is the ability to\nlearn from such weaker supervision. Indeed, some of the algorithms we've\nused above have alternate ways to pass some supervision about the metric\nwe want to learn. The way to go is to pass a 2D array `pairs` of pairs,\nas well as an array of labels `pairs_labels` such that for each `i` between\n`0` and `n_pairs` we want `X[pairs[i, 0], :]` and `X[pairs[i, 1], :]` to be\nsimilar if `pairs_labels[i] == 1`, and we want them to be dissimilar if\n`pairs_labels[i] == -1`. In other words, we\nwant to enforce a metric that projects similar points closer together and\ndissimilar points further away from each other. This kind of input is\npossible for ITML, SDML, and MMC. See `weakly_supervised_section` for\ndetails on other kinds of weak supervision that some algorithms can work\nwith.\n\nFor the purpose of this example, we're going to explicitly create these\npairwise constraints through the labels we have, i.e. `y`.\nDo keep in mind that we are doing this method because we know the labels\n- we can actually create the constraints any way we want to depending on\nthe data!\n\nNote that this is what metric-learn did under the hood in the previous\nexamples (do check out the\n`constraints` module!) - but we'll try our own version of this. We're\ngoing to go ahead and assume that two points labeled the same will be\ncloser than two points in different labels.\n\n"

A bit different from our old result, but not too\ndifferent.\n\nRCA and LSML also have their own specific ways of taking in inputs -\nit's worth one's while to poke around in the constraints.py file to see\nhow exactly this is going on.\n\nFinally, one of the main advantages of metric-learn is its out-of-the box\ncompatibility with scikit-learn, for doing `model selection\n<https://scikit-learn.org/stable/model_selection.html>`__,\ncross-validation, and scoring for instance. Indeed, supervised algorithms are\nregular `sklearn.base.TransformerMixin` that can be plugged into any\npipeline or cross-validation procedure. And weakly-supervised estimators are\nalso compatible with scikit-learn, since their input dataset format described\nabove allows to be sliced along the first dimension when doing\ncross-validations (see also this `section <sklearn_compat_ws>`). You\ncan also look at some `use cases <use_cases>` where you could combine\nmetric-learn with scikit-learn estimators.\n\n"
